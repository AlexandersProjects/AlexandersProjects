# Hi there 👋
I'm Alexander, a **Java Backend Developer** and **Developer Experience Engineer** with a passion 
for software that solves problems and automates stuff, focused on building **automation systems and developer platforms**.
After completing my master's degree in Biology, I found that the systematic and curious mindset from science transfers perfectly into tech 
— both are about understanding complex systems and making them work better.
<br>

Today, I build tools that help developers ship with confidence and focus on creativity, not chaos.
> 💡 My mission: **Build developer platforms and automation systems that enhance human creativity, support sustainability, and integrate AI responsibly.**
---
## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Spring Boot APIs** with security, monitoring & database integration  
- **Dockerized deployments** for fast and reproducible dev environments  
- Building automation tools to enhance **developer experience**
- Exploring **responsible AI integration** into developer workflows

## About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Java Backend Developer.
- 🌱 I’m passionate about agile methodologies and the evolving landscape of technologies.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in fantasy novels (or trying to write one myself), strumming away on my guitar, or pondering the intricacies of philosophy.

### [ANOVA of tips (Python)](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/ANOVA_python)
My ANOVA analysis with python of a freely available tips-dataset.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
* Explored the data
  * Boxplots
  * QQ-plots
  * Histograms
  * Used different R libraries for data exploration
* Controlled the data for outliers
* Compared if the total bills are statistically significantly different per weekday.

## Hypothesis

H1: The weekday has an effect on the amount of the total bill.
(M[1] != M[2] != M[3] != M[4])

H0: The weekday has no effect on the amount of the total bill.
(M[1] = M[2] = M[3] = M[4])

## Conclusion
### ANOVA
The weekday has a significant influence on the total bill (F(3, 240) = 2.767 , p = 0.0424). 3.34 % of the spread of the total sum can be explained by the weekday. According to Cohen (1988) is the effect size of 0.186 a small effect.

### Post-hoc-Test
The Bonferroni Post-Hoc-Test shows that no groups can be generalized out of the weekday (all p > 0.05). Thursday (M=17.68, SD=7.89, N=62), Friday (M=17.15, SD=8.30, N=19), Saturday (M=20.44, SD=9.48, N=87) and Sunday (M=21.41, SD=8.83, N=76) are not significantly different.

It can be concluded that no independent groups can be formed that differ from each other. Hence, although the ANOVA was significant, the H0 is kept and H1 declined.

### [Statistical Exploration of tips (Python)](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/stats_in_python)
My statistical exploration with python of a freely available tips-dataset.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
* Explored the data
  * Boxplots
  * QQ-plots
  * Histograms
  * Used different Python libraries for data exploration
* Controlled the data for outliers
* Used Pearson to check if there is a correlation between the total bill and the tip
* Compared if man and woman give significantly different tips.

## Conclusion
### Pearson
The tip and the total bill correlate positively significant (r = 0.6757341, p < 2.2e-16, n = 244). Hence, it can be said the higher the total bill the higher the tip. 45.66 % of the spread of the whole variance can be explained through the tip and the total bill. According to Cohen (1992) is the effect size of 0.68 a strong effect. The H0 can be discarded.

### T-Test
There is no significant difference between the tip of women (M = 2.83, SD = 1.16, n = 87) and man (M = 3.09, SD = 1.49, n = 157), (t(242) = -1.3879, p= 0.1665, n=244)). According to Cohen (1992) is the effect size of 0.185 no effect. The H0 cannot be discarded.

### [Freedom Status ANOVA (R)](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/freedom_comparison_worldwide)
My statistical exploration with python of a freely available freedom-status-dataset.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
* Explored the data
  * Boxplots
  * QQ-plots
  * Histograms
  * Used different R libraries for data exploration
* Controlled the data for outliers
* Compared if the different Freedom status are statistically significantly different groups.

## Hypothesis

H1: There is a mean difference between degree of freedom and the relative GDP.
(FS[F] != FS[NF] != FS[PF])

H0: There is no mean difference between degree of freedom and the relative GDP.
(FS[F] = FS[NF] = FS[PF])

## Conclusion
### ANOVA
The degree of freedom has a signifikant influence on the relative GDP (F(2, 49.062) = 15.491 , p = 6.097e-06). 19.4 % of the variation in the relative GDP around the overall mean can be explained by the degree of freedom. The effect strength according to Cohen (1988) is f = 0.4907 and corresponds to a strong effect.

### Post-hoc-Test
The Tukey post-hoc-test shows, that two groups can be constructed according to degree of freedom (all p < .05): free (M = 27841401	, SD = 26632852, N = 56), and not-free (M = 12368148, SD = 18508685,N = 21) and partially-free (M = 6202767	, SD = 10345156, N=44) form the second group.

It can be concluded that two independent groups can be formed that differ from each other. Freedom is the most effective. H0 is declined, H1 accepted.

### [Pokemon comparison (R)](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/legendary_pokemon_comparison)
In this project, I compared the legendary pokemon in R.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
* Explored the data
* Controlled the data
* Compared if legendary pokemon have statistically higher attack than non-legendary pokemon.

## Hypothesis

H0: The attack of legendary pokemon is lower or equal than of non-legendary pokemon.
(M[L] </= M[NL])

H1: The attack of legendary pokemon higher than of non-legendary pokemon.
(M[L] > M[NL])

## Conclusion
Legendary (M = 116.68, SD = 30.35, n = 65) pokemon have significantly higher attacks than non-legendary (M = 75.67, SD = 30.49, n = 735) pokemon (t(798) = -10.397, p = 2.513e-05, n= 798). Hence, the H0 can be discarded.
The effect-size is d = 3.438535 and is according to Cohen (1988) a very strong effect.
